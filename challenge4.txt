Challenge 4

- Write the error: The error is an uninitialised constant. ie. the class we want
to creat a new instance of does not exist yet.
- Write file path where error occured. The error occured in the last line
printed on the terminal. ie. the error occured in line 1 of irb.
- Write line number of the error is on line 1 of irb
- The NameError clearly states that the constant (class) does not exist, so
we cant creste a new instance of a class that does not exist yet.
- To solve the error we would first need to create a new class, that way we
could add a new instance to that class.
